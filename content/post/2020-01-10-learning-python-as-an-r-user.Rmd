Below, I've embedded a Python [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) hosted on [Kyso](https://docs.kyso.io/), which is a hub where you, "can publish Jupyter notebooks, charts, code, datasets and write articles in our custom markdown editor." This is a work in progress while I teach myself Python (here is the original Kyso post, [nmmichalak/python_selfteach](https://kyso.io/nmmichalak/python_selfteach)).
